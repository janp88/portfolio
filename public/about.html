<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome! I’m Jan Vladimir Padilla, a dedicated professional with over 10 years of experience in the BPO industry. Currently, I work as an appointment setter for a used car dealership, where I help streamline client interactions and enhance customer engagement. </p>

<p>Beyond my current role, I specialize in Facebook media buying and social media marketing, leveraging digital platforms to drive brand awareness and sales. My passion for technology has also led me to pursue web development, and I’m actively investing time in learning how to code to expand my skill set. </p>

<p>With a strong background in communication, marketing, and tech, I’m always looking for new opportunities to grow and collaborate with like-minded individuals. If you’re interested in working together, let’s connect! </p>
